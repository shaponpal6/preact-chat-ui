            learn and try new things, new tech stacks and understand different
            approaches of development.
            <br />
            <br />
            My Skills and experiences on PHP, JavaScript, python, Node JS,
            WordPress, React, Webpack, Redux, Android, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebace,
            socket.io, webRTC, Laravel, Django, Codeigniter etc. <br />
            <br />
            I'm enthusiastic. I love to learn new things.
